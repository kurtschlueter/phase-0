# 0. Pseudocode

  # The Input will be a positive integer (1000000)
  # The output will be a string of that integer with commas ('1,000,000')
  # This looks like 3 if statements that will work on the length of the input
    # if length <= 3 then send input out as input.to_s
    # if length > 3 then make edits to input.to_s
      # for (iterate through length of input.to_s)
        # if after n * 3rd digit
          # add comma
        # else
          # continue onto next iteration
