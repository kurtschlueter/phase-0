## What is a wireframe?

For our purposes, a wireframe is just a blueprint of a project GUI. It is a basic layout of what the interface will look like. A more advanced wireframe can also demonstrate how a user would interact with the layout. To really get a graphical idea of what the site/project would look like and how users would interact, wireframes should be created for every possible state.

## What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing seems useful to me because it allows for the creator to get a fundamental idea of what a project will look like without getting distacted by content or the flow of the software. It allows for compartmentalizing the design process.

## Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes and no. I do not really know how I want my site to look like yet. I need more time to research ideas and to contemplate what I really want out of this project. Wireframing did help with the brainstorming process. I will definately wireframe once I have a clearer understanding.

## Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I stuck with my first idea. I will definately revise in the future.

## What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Balsamiq is what I used for my wireframe. They have a web demo that had enough features to complete the fundamentals. I am debating whether or not I should get the actual software.

## Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I appreciate the value of a wireframe. I did not find it tedious.
