- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

HTML is a pretty straightforward language. I have not yet mastered all of its intricacies but the basics are still pretty easy to implement. I really like that HTML deals with content and its organizational structure only. I like things compartmentalized like that. It just makes logical sense. I cannot wait to start implementing CSS, JS, PHP to create vivid and functional pages. One step at a time.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Since HTML is the main (maybe even only) markup language used to structure web pages, it was pretty easy finding whatever I needed.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

It’s tough at first. I caught myself several times fiddling with headers and such. I just have that compulsive desire to make the webpage as nice to look at as possible. I’m sure I’ll kick the habit once I can fill that void with CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I love the structure. The semantic nature of HTML makes it easy to work with and understand. I’m not sure what people could complain about. It obviously is very limiting in functionality but thats not its job.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
