## What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

**1. Information Gathering** - Find out the purpose of the site, what the content will be, who the target audience is, etc...
**2. Planning** - Use the information in step 1 to put together a plan.
**3. Design** - Build the prototype for what the site will look like.
**4. Development** - Build the site.
**5. Testing and Delivery** - Testing the site and pushing it out to production if ready.
**6. Maintenance** - Maintaining the site and keeping it up to date with the current standards.

## What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal is to have it aid in my career development. It almost feels like this website will serve as a resume and as well as a character description for others to peruse. It is hard to know readily what specifics my website will feature but I hope to be able to showcase my work as well as demonstrate who I am as a person.

## What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

Simple. My target audience will be potential employers and I will be working nonstop figuring out how to address their interests.

## What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Yes, yes, and yes. The user should be able to get an idea of who I am as a person, what my capabilities are, and what my ambitions are. These will show not only through the sites content, but also through how it is designed.

## What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
## What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience (UX) is how someone feels when interacting with a product. This concept's scope reaches far beyond web design and is very valuable. The more intuituve and robust a product is, the more successful it becomes. Websites and applications are no different. Quite simply, UX design focuses on the users experience. It is important to note that there is no right answer to UX design. Every product/website is unique. Target audiences, project goals, financial limitations, etc can vary drastically and affect the UX design.

## Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I do not know how I feel about outsourcing UX design. I will have to read more about it but it seems like that should be done in-house. Plus, I do not really understand how that skill is so speciallized. I don't want to insult anyone so I'll leave it at that.
