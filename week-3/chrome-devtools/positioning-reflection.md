## How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome's DevTools is great for immediate feedback for the changes you made. It is much more efficient than toggling back and forth from an editor to a browser where you have to make the changes in the editor, save them, then go to the browser and hit refresh. I wish I had known about this before doing the solo challenge. Chrome DevTools also gives you a nice color palate that allows you to peruse color options effortlessly. I will continue to write the bulk of my CSS using the editor but will use DevTools to play around with options once the basic structure is set up.

## How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can resize elements using width and height.

## What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Fixed elements are not part of the flow. They are positioned relative to the browser window and do not move when scrolling occurs.

Absolute elements are also not part of the flow. They are positioned relative to their containerâ€™s. If no container exists, an absolute element is positioned relative to the browser window but does  move along the page with scrolling.

Static elements are part of the flow and show in order of creation in HTML file. They cannot be maneuvered using the properties top, bottom, left, or right like absolute or fixed can.

Relative elements are part of the flow and are positioned relative to their initial static position using top, left, bottom, right.


## What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Padding clears an area outside of the content. Then comes the border. Then comes the margin which clears an area outside of the border.

## What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I liked the challenge. Chrome DevTools will prove to be super useful. CSS can get frusterating because some aspects can seem unintuitive. I wished the properties were more self-containing instead of depending on what values are set for other properties. I am new to this however so I might not be seeing the bigger picture.
