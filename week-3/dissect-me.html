<!--

The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.

The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not
contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation
links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.

The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it
independently from the rest of the site.

The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers,
footers, or any other sections of the document.

<section> could be a child of a <article>

The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  I will use <nav> since it fits perfectly for the tab menu I want on the left side of
  my page. I also see myslef using <header> and <footer> quite frequently in the future.
  It is good practice to use specific semantic tags over <div> becuase it makes a
  script more organized, readable, and sets a standard in which other developers can
  use and follow. <div> is too personal and requires someone looking through the
  code to know what the class or id specifications are for.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display
elements?

  Elements get laid out one after the other (ususally vertically) depending on
  attribute specificatons. The browser displays elements in the order they are in the
  script. So even if you have a <header> tag but it comes as the last tag in the <body>,
  it will be printed last. CSS should be used to manipulate display.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more
handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

  I learned about snippets and will definately use them in the future. I can imagine
  creating a standard template for a webpage that I will use over and over again. I
  will certainly create a snippet for it.

I also want to mention how nice using the chrome dev inspector was. I will be using this
ridgorously going forward to pick up styling/ structure ideas and tips.
